## 🎰 How Aviator Works at Stake Casino

The mechanics of Aviator are deceptively simple yet endlessly engaging:
<ul>

<li>Place your bet before the round begins.</li>
<li>Watch as a small red plane lifts off from the ground.</li>
<li>The longer it flies, the higher the multiplier grows.</li>
<li>Cash out before the plane disappears to lock in your win.</li>
<li>Wait too long, and the plane crashes — taking your bet with it.</li>
</ul>

That’s it. But it’s the psychology of risk and reward that keeps players hooked. You never quite know when the crash will happen, and that suspense is what makes each round electric.
